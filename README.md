As a final-year computer science student, I am passionate about leveraging technology to solve complex problems and create innovative solutions. Throughout my academic journey, I have honed my skills in programming, algorithm design, and software development, and I'm excited to showcase my portfolio, which reflects the diverse projects and experiences that have shaped my growth as a software engineer and data scientist.

# Data Science & Machine Learning Projects
## Project 1 (CSGO skin & item dataset)
CSGO is an online competitive shooter with its own in-game economy consisting of "skins" for the in-game weapons. Currently, there are roughly 3500 CSGO skins in the game which doesn't count other items as well. There are currently no public data sets available for all of these skins.
### Technologies used
- Python
- BeautifulSoup
- Pandas
- JupyerNoteBook
- Anaconda
- Datasets
This [site](https://csgostash.com/) has data on all of the CSGO items, however, the search function is not the best for finding skins via a filter or query. This would be the site I would scrape to create my dataset.

### Opportunities & challenges
As stated previously, this dataset would likely have at least 3,500 rows but possibly many more than that with many dimensions for each row. This would involve a lot of scraping of the website referenced earlier and cleaning and processing of this raw data which would be a good opportunity to learn the principles of web scraping and cleaning/processing of data.
There would also be the challenge of finding the most optimal way of doing this with efficiency in mind.

## Project 2 (UFC Stats and Visualisations)
This project aims to look at UFC fight data and to be able to conduct an analysis of past UFC fights and potentially find some insights. These insights would include some generic statistics such as how long a UFC fight generally lasts, how many fights end via a decision, etc. These would also provide the opportunity to find the athletes who are outliers when compared to the rest of the roster in certain areas.

Once enough statistics have been found, I plan on using some machine learning to see if it is possible to make any predictions. While it is unlikely to be able to make a model that is accurate due to many external factors affecting the outcome of fights, it would be interesting to see how accurate a model could be.

### Data set:
The following [link](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rajeevw/ufcdata) has a kaggle dataset that contains comprehensive data on all UFC fights from 1993 to 2021 which has been scraped from the official UFC stats [page](http://www.ufcstats.com/statistics/events/completed).

###Technologies to use:
-   Python
-   JupyterNotebooks
-   Anaconda

### Opportunities & Challenge
This project would provide the opportunity to work with a large dataset and be able to find statistics. Certain stats can be difficult to calculate for UFC fights or fighters. Likewise, when calculating certain metrics such as who is able to take the most strikes to the face, some data has to be ignored such as fighters with very few fights in the UFC and this will outline some of the challenges of data science in terms of isolating valid data. When creating models for making predictions this would also be important as some fight/fight data could skew model results due to certain fighters not having enough fight data and this would also be a learning opportunity to understand how to decide what data to include when creating models for prediction

# Software Development Projects
## Insurance GUI Project
This project was done during my PLC course where the goal of the project was to create a GUI program for an insurance broker to enter details of a customer and calculate the cost of an insurance quote for them. This was a team project.

### Technologies used:
-   Java, Java Swing

## POS Management GUI
This was a college project done during the second year of my course. It involved creating a GUI system for POS management system for an online store. The goal was to create a system that could handle sales and refunds of store products but also manage system administration tasks such as adding new employees and stock items.
## Technologies used:
-   Java, Java Swing MySQL

## Assembly Game
This was a college project done during the second year of my course that involved creating a game in assembly with the theme of reducing carbon emissions in the world. With this project, I decided to create a turn-based game where a player has limited resources to purchase structures that would reduce global carbon emissions in the world and had a finite amount of turns to reduce carbon levels before it is too late.
